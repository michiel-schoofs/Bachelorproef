# Ipfs

- To initiliase a node we use the command `peer init` -> We get a unique peer id also initialises a directory
-  IPFS  supports versioning on a P2P network.

- Content adressing as opposed to location based addressing
- When storing an image: image -> Raw -> Hashfunction like Sha2-512 -> digest -> self describing hashing (CID) to future proof the hash function.

## Conclusion 

**[IPFS](http://ipfs.io) is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files.** In some ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git  objects.  IPFS could become a new major subsystem of the internet. If  built right, it could complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even more. It sounds crazy. It is crazy
