This survey also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the Internet. Finally, we discuss architectural trade-offs and provide guidelines for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements of a given application. This memo provides information for the Internet community.},

  abstract  = {In 25 concise steps, you will learn the basics of blockchain technology. Mathematical formulas, program code, and computer science jargon are not used. No previous knowledge in computer science, mathematics, programming, or cryptography is required.  Terminology is explained through pictures, analogies, and metaphors. This book bridges the gap that exists between purely technical books about the blockchain and purely business-focused books. It does so by explaining both the technical concepts that make up the blockchain and their role in business-relevant applications.What You Will Learn:What the blockchain isWhy it is needed and what problem it solvesWhy there is so much excitement about the blockchain and its potentialMajor components and their purposeHow components work and interactLimitations, why they exist, and what has been done to overcome themMajor application scenarios Who This Book Is For:The primary readership is professionals of the financial industry, including team leaders, project managers, business analysts, consultants, bankers, brokers, interbank dealers, asset managers, traders, insurance brokers, custodians, policy makers, and regulators. The secondary readership is students of business, economics, and law. },
